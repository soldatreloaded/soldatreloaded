## Commit messages

	type(scope): what the change is

Lower case after the colon, no full stop, short enough to read down a log. The subject
says what the change *is*, not what was done to the files: `feat(net): interpolate
others, number own bullets, drop guessed knockback`, not `updated netcode files`.

The types:

- `feat` — something the game or the tools can now do.
- `fix` — behaviour that was wrong and now is not.
- `refactor` — the same behaviour, arranged differently.
- `perf` — the same behaviour, faster or smaller on the wire.
- `docs` — the readme, docs/, the comments that carry reasoning.
- `test` — tests, and the tools that run them.
- `build` — xmake.lua, the flags, the packaging, the workflows.
- `chore` — everything else: files in, files out, housekeeping.

The scope is the part of the tree the change lands in, named as the tree names it: a
package (`client`, `server`, `shared`, `launcher`), a part of one (`game`, `weapons`,
`net`, `console`, `hud`, `anim`, `polymap`), or a part of the install (`config`, `data`,
`mods`, `scripts`), and `readme`, `docs`, `tests`, `ci`. Leave it out when the change is
the whole repo's.

### The body

A subject is enough for a small change. Anything that changes how the game behaves gets
a body, and the body is for the *why*: what was wrong, what rule the new code follows,
and what it measured. The netcode only makes sense as a series of arguments, and those
arguments live in the log. From the history:

> **fix(server): drop duplicate queued commands and advance tick during replay**
>
> A resent command was found in the queue and inserted again anyway, so the server
> applied commands several times over and every prediction was a few ticks off. The
> replay now advances the world tick per command, as the server will, so what reads
> the tick (jet fuel) predicts the same.

Numbers belong there too. A change to the netcode says what it measured, on what line,
so the next person can tell whether they made it better or worse.

Nothing is co-authored to a tool. A commit-msg hook strips those trailers if one
arrives.

## Branches

- `main` is the line of work. It builds and its tests pass.
- Work small enough to land in one go lands on `main`. Work that is not gets a branch
  named after its commit type: `feat/po-editor`, `fix/burst-bullets`.
- A branch merges with its history rather than squashed. The bodies of those commits
  are the reasoning, and squashing throws it away.
- Anything else is deleted once it has been merged or abandoned. A stale branch that
  nobody will say is stale costs more than it stores.

## Releases

Tags are `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, annotated, on `main`. Nothing is released yet; the first
will be `v0.1.0`.

While the major is 0:

- MINOR for anything a player would notice: a mode, a menu, a weapon, an editor.
- PATCH for fixes and for work nobody can see.

The wire decides the rest. A Hello carries the layout of the state and a build that
does not match is refused, so any release that changes the protocol will not talk to
the one before it. Say so in the tag's message, every time.

A tag is the version; what ships beside it is the game, the server and
the contents of `assets/` (`data/`, `mods/default/` and `scripts/`), unpacked flat so
that the art sits beside the executable: the packages `xmake dist` makes (see
xmake.lua). The server's package ships `scripts/main.lua` too. No config ships: the
game and the server each make theirs at the install's root with the defaults where it
is missing (`client.config.json`, `server.config.json`), and a server's lists and
weapons mod sit beside them, so unpacking a release over an install leaves them as they
are. The tag alone is not a release until those exist.

Players start the game (`Soldat Reloaded.exe`, `soldatreloaded` on Linux), at the
top of the install, whose updater keeps their copy at the newest release as it starts
(launcher/updater.h, launcher/update.h) and hosts Local Play itself; the server
package's `server` sits at its top, the one executable there. On Linux the game's
package keeps `soldatreloaded-launcher`, the launcher's name when it was apart from the
game, as a script that starts the game: a launcher from then updates itself into it
first, and players' shortcuts to it still play. Each
release carries, for each platform, the game (`soldatreloaded-<version>-<platform>.zip`,
what a player downloads) and a manifest naming every file of an install by its hash; the
updater compares the install with it and brings what differs, those files alone, out
of the game's zip where it lies, or the zip whole when most of it changed. So a release
costs a player what it changed. The manifest lists every file the release ships; the
updater treats each by where it lies, weighing the file on disk against the last
release's manifest and the new one (launcher/update.h):

- **The release's own**, kept as it has it: the top-level files (the game,
  `version.txt`), `data/`, `mods/default/` and `scripts/examples/`. Missing or
  otherwise, it is brought, damage repaired; dropped by a release, deleted.
- **Everything else a release ships** (`scripts/main.lua`):
  its start of a file that is then the player's. It is made where it never was, brought
  anew only while it is still as the last release made it, left alone once the player
  has changed it, stays out once they take it out, and
  goes with a release that drops it only unchanged.

Any other mod in `mods/`, `demos/` and what a server writes beside its own install are the
player's and the server owner's, in no manifest, and never touched. So:

- A release that adds a cvar registers it in code with its default (`cvar_register`), and
  its help, which the settings files show beside it: a file has its line commented out
  while it holds the default, so a new or changed default reaches everyone who hasn't set it.
- A new default bind goes in the code (input_default_binds, or the client's VIEW_BINDS) and
  reaches every player who hasn't bound that key otherwise.
- The newest *published* release is the one every launcher moves to, so a release that
  shouldn't go out to players is made a pre-release or left a draft.

Pushing the tag makes them. The release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml)
builds the packages on Windows and Linux and runs the tests (ci.yml, which runs the same
on every push to main and every pull request), attaches the archives to a GitHub release
named after the tag, with the tag's message as its notes, and announces it on Discord
(discord-notify.yml), each step only if the one before succeeded. So the
version in xmake.lua's `set_version` is bumped in a commit before the tag, the tag's
message is written for players to read, and a tag whose tests fail releases nothing.
