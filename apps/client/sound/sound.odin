package sound

// The game's sounds, placed where they happen from where the camera listens: shots,
// impacts, footsteps, jets, the voices a soldier keeps (reload, jets, the minigun), the
// menus' clicks. Driven by each tick's events and the soldiers' animations.
//
//   sound.odin     the state, its settings, a frame's upkeep, a flat sound
//   voices.odin    the samples, the voices that play them, placing one from the listener
//   tick.odin      a tick's sounds: the listener, then everything that sounded, in order
//   events.odin    what each event and ruling sounds like
//   soldiers.odin  each soldier against the tick before: footsteps, jets, reloads, antics
//
// On raylib's audio:
//   - a sample is a raylib Sound made from the frames core/resources decodes; a voice
//     plays it through an alias of its own, so one sample plays overlapping. 256 voices,
//     the original's 128 free sources and four per soldier; a play takes a free one, else
//     the oldest that isn't a loop
//   - each play is placed from the listener, the soldier the camera follows or the free
//     camera: gain volume * (1 - d / 750), silent past that, panned as OpenAL panned the
//     original. What is mine alone (my death, my headshot, the ringing, the clock, the
//     menus) is flat, at the listener
//   - a soldier keeps four voices of its own (reload, jets, gattling, gattling2), which
//     are refreshed while they play rather than started again
//   - the loops (jets, chainsaw, wind) wrap seamlessly, as the original's
//     AL_LOOPING sources do. raylib has no looping Sound, so a loop is an AudioStream fed
//     from the sample's frames, round and round, every frame (sound_update). It is played
//     every tick it is wanted, and stops LOOP_HELD ticks after the last
//   - with battle_effects a far shot or blast also plays its distant sample; with
//     explosion_effects a blast next to me rings the ears and muffles the rest
//
// Purely a listener: nothing here changes the game.
//
// Uses: raylib audio, core/game, core/resources, draw (the sparks' noises). From the C
// client: audio/audio.c.
