// The gostek, a soldier's art: sprites pinned to its skeleton's points, one table of
// parts drawn in its order (GostekGraphics.pas, by way of the C client's
// render/gostek.c). Each part sits on one point, turned to face another, placed so its
// own point `center` (0 to 1 across the image) lands on the first. Some stretch along
// their length; most have a mirrored image for facing left, and an image of their own
// for the second team. The wounds (ranny/) follow the part each covers, and show as the
// health runs low.
//
// Its look is the player's: the shirt, the pants, the skin and the hair in their
// colours, its style (the male, as the original's, in gostek-gfx itself; the female,
// waifu, rat and furry, which the original hasn't, each in its own folder under it), and
// its hair, headgear and chain. The hair and the headgear are every style's, in
// gostek-gfx itself as the original's, one file per style; the rat and the furry wear
// only dreadlocks, punk, Mr. T, the mullet and the wolfcut, and no headgear. So an
// original mod's gostek-gfx dresses
// the male, his hair and his headgear as it is. The chain and the
// dreadlocks hang from the points 21 to 24, which the simulation swings. The cigar shows
// while one is in the mouth, and the helmet or the hat sits in the hand while the brow
// is wiped or it is taken off.
