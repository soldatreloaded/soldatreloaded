// The keyboard and mouse made into a command for my soldier, through the player's binds;
// and the keys the menus and chat read.
//
// A key bound to a button's command ("+left", "+fire") holds that button down while it
// is; the one-shot buttons (throw, change, prone, …) are kept from the frame they go
// down until a tick takes them, so a press between two ticks is never lost or counted
// twice. A key bound to anything else ("escmenu", "chat") is an action, handed to the
// caller the frame it goes down. A key pressed with a modifier held is bound as
// "alt+q" where that has a bind, and as "q" where not.
//
// The mouse is the original's: the system cursor is hidden and held in the window (the
// client holds it while a match is shown), and the game keeps its own, moved by the
// mouse's motion times the sensitivity and kept inside the view, in the view's units
// (480 tall, whatever the window), so it feels the same at any window size. The motion
// is the mouse's raw counts, as SDL's relative mode gives the original's: raylib turns
// GLFW's raw motion on with the cursor held, so no acceleration of the system's is in it.
// It is drawn, as the camera is, `alpha` of the way from where it was at the last tick's
// start (MousePrev).
//
// Uses: raylib, core/game. From the C client: input/input.c.
